// s1.receiveGrade(s1.courses[0], 100)

// Create a Teacher class which also inherits from Person

// A Teacher should also have a salary attribute
// The value of salary should come in from the constructor
// As well, Teacher should have a method called giveGrade
// The method should receive a student*, a course name, and a grade, and invoke the student's receiveGrade method




// const s1 = new Student("Ronda", 2017)
// const t1 = new Teacher("Cassandra", 2002, 40000)

// t1.giveGrade(s1, "Algebra II", 82)
// const firstGrade = s1.grades[0]

// console.log(`${s1.name} received an ${firstGrade.grade} in ${firstGrade.course}`)
//above should print "Ronda received an 82 in Algebra II"ï»¿


// override the addCourse method and courses attribute in the Teacher class.

// Instead of courses being an array, it should be an object
// The object should track the amount of times the teacher adds the course
// Instead of addCourse pushing to an array (which now doesn't exist), it should update the course count in courses


// Use the following code to see if you did it right before looking at the answer:

// const t1 = new Teacher("Cassandra", 2002, 40000)
// t1.addCourse("Algebra II")
// t1.addCourse("Algebra II")
// t1.addCourse("Trigonometry")
// console.log(t1.courses) //should print {Algebra II: 2, Trigonometry: 1}


// Create a Principal class.



// It should inherit from Person, and have the following additional attributes and methods:

// teachers - an array of Teacher objects
// hireTeacher - a method that receives a teacher and adds it to the teachers array
// It should also console log "<principal name> just hired <teacher name>"
// students an array of Student objects
// recruitStudent - a method that receives a student and adds it to the students array
// expelStudent - a method that receives a student and removes it from the studentsarray (for now, you can just search by name)
// transferStudent - a method that receives a student and a principal, removes the student from students and pushes it to the other principal's students array
